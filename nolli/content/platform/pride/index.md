* We must address the persistent racial and economic segregation we see in our campuses and vertical teams, and work with community leaders, teachers, parents, and students to value, invest in, create, and sustain an integrated AISD.
* We must unequivocally declare that the lives of Black and Brown people matter and then follow through with investing in Black and Brown students and teachers, and working hand-in-hand with Black and Brown community leaders, teachers, parents and students.
* AISD must allocate funding for, procure, and move forward with an external, independent equity assessment/audit of academics, facilities, and finances.
* The district must develop a strategic enrollment plan that is innovative and inclusive and encourages families and students to opt in to AISD with confidence.
