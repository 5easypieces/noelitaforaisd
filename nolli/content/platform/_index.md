When I was in fifth grade, I made two promises to myself: one, to graduate from college, and two, to help children and families. I was able to accomplish both because along the way I had people in my life who believed in me, who saw something in me that I didnâ€™t see in myself.

I am running for AISD school board because I want all kids, regardless of socio-economic status, learning abilities and exceptionalities, race or identity, to have a chance to succeed in the classroom and in life.
