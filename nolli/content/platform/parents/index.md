* The community deserves transparent & proactive communication from the district. The current Board practice of refusing to speak to the media is inappropriate, undemocratic, and must end.  Elected officials are accountable to the public and the people rely upon the press to stay informed.  In addition, the district and school board trustees must provide authentic community engagement and proactively reach out to communities, meeting parents and caregivers where they are, and in a manner that is accessible (linguistically, physically and otherwise).
* Cultural differences and linguistic abilities must be treated as a community asset upon which to build, and not a burden or a deficit.
* Educational opportunities must be made accessible to all parts of the community so that parents/caregivers are not over-burdened, and all children have access to opportunities.
