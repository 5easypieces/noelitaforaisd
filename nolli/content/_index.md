Dr. Foster is an educational anthropologist and professor at The University of Texas at Austin. He has more than twenty years of experience working with middle school, high school, undergraduate and graduate students. While a UT graduate student, he directed LEAP (Leadership Enrichment Arts Program) founded by Austin Civil Rights icon Ada Anderson, and for several years was a teaching assistant to Dr. John Warfield, after whom the Warfield Center on the UT Campus is named. In 2005, at LBJ High School, Dr. Foster, principal Patrick Patterson, and several male 10th graders founded COBRA student leadership and academic development program. COBRA subsequently expanded to several AISD schools. In 2007, several female students at McCallum High School requested support for their specific interests, which is how VOICES was formed.
