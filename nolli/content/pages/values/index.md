> “In 2019, several hundred AISD families participated in conversations about what AISD should stand for. The values participants came up with during these “Reframe the Game” conversations are as important as ever, and powerfully inform my thinking about what I’d like to stand for as an AISD Trustee.”  — Kevin Foster

## Equity: Lifting up the Least Privileged
Planning should be thoughtful and first attend to the needs of the least privileged, most vulnerable, historically marginalized and special needs students and then work to ensure the needs of the historically privileged are attended to as well. Budgetary sacrifices should be shared, and never borne disproportionately by the most vulnerable or historically marginalized. Benefits to marginalized communities support their academic and socio-economic ascendance and their overall well-being in schools; benefits to already privileged communities maintain their stability and overall well being.

## Excellence: In Planning, Teaching, Curriculum, Programs, and Leadership
Schools should include well-resourced, thoughtfully developed, research-backed, up-to-date programs with culturally relevant curriculum. Schools should be staffed with experienced, culturally proficient teachers who are experts in their content area, are matched to their expertise and passions, and who know and love their school community. Planning should reflect scholarly research and community voices, should be well-conceived, and include the human, material and leadership resources needed for success.

## Balance: Power, Diversity, Resources and Opportunities
All schools should include a diversity of students, teachers, and leadership within its walls. Resources and opportunities should be balanced so that every student has the broadest range of academic and programmatic options available to them. Diversity includes ethnicity, economic status, special abilities and home language, and requires that power be shared across groups.

## Growth: Expanding with the City
As Austin continues to grow, our student bodies and schools should grow as well. Programs, schools, school boundaries, and feeder patterns should operate in ways that encourage students and families to enroll and participate in our schools with confidence.
