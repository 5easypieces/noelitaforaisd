## Students
_All students are entitled to and should have access to a rich educational experience so that they can actualize their highest potential academically and in life._

We must ensure:
* High expectations, high academic standards and high-level curriculum programming & culturally responsive instructional strategies that help ALL learners flourish.
* Students with disabilities and exceptionalities, including dyslexia, receive Special Education that is inclusive, and evidence based.
* Testing is one small piece of educational assessment and should not be used as the main metric to track student progress: Test scores must not be weaponized against students, their families, or teachers.
* Student voices must be solicited, respected, and heard.
* Resources are prioritized for students with the least advantages.

## Parents/Caregivers/Community
_Parents & caregivers must be authentically engaged, heard, and respected as the foremost experts on the needs of our children and schools._

* The community deserves transparent & proactive communication from the district. The current Board practice of refusing to speak to the media is inappropriate, undemocratic, and must end.  Elected officials are accountable to the public and the people rely upon the press to stay informed.  In addition, the district and school board trustees must provide authentic community engagement and proactively reach out to communities, meeting parents and caregivers where they are, and in a manner that is accessible (linguistically, physically and otherwise).
* Cultural differences and linguistic abilities must be treated as a community asset upon which to build, and not a burden or a deficit.
* Educational opportunities must be made accessible to all parts of the community so that parents/caregivers are not over-burdened, and all children have access to opportunities.  

## Teachers
_Campus leaders and educators must be respected and consulted as the professionals they are when determining effective approaches to teaching and learning and accountability._

__Teachers are NOT expendable. AISD must:__
* Value the health and safety of teachers.
* Recruit and retain diverse and talented teachers and principals who understand and love the communities in which they teach.
* Provide teachers and campus leaders with professional development and equip them with the resources, curriculum and support needed to deliver meaningful and effective instruction that meets the needs of students and offers the excellent academic opportunities.
    * This includes learning opportunities where educators can understand how our frames of reference, backgrounds, biases, and beliefs influence how we have historically contributed to the disparities and inequalities in the school system.
* Ensure that compensation and salary schedules encourage experienced educators to pursue career advancement in the classroom.
* Maintain an ombudsperson that is a permanent part of the district and provide administrative leaders and staff with the skills and support needed to cultivate a healthy work environment that thrives on collaboration, innovation, and respect.  

## Pride
_The Austin community supports our public schools and wants to feel pride in the work of AISD.  Austin ISD can be a school district we can all feel proud of, one that reflects an alignment of our values and our educational practices._

* We must address the persistent racial and economic segregation we see in our campuses and vertical teams, and work with community leaders, teachers, parents, and students to value, invest in, create, and sustain an integrated AISD.
* We must unequivocally declare that the lives of Black and Brown people matter and then follow through with investing in Black and Brown students and teachers, and working hand-in-hand with Black and Brown community leaders, teachers, parents and students.
* AISD must allocate funding for, procure, and move forward with an external, independent equity assessment/audit of academics, facilities, and finances.
* The district must develop a strategic enrollment plan that is innovative and inclusive and encourages families and students to opt in to AISD with confidence.
